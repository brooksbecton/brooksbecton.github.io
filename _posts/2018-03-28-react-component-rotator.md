React Component Rotator is a React component I made that takes in children and can rotate them in intervals while cleaning up timers on re-renders. When it was almost complete, I realized the issues with animating React components and how Facebook has fixed this.

## Why? 

In the beginning, I was wanted to just get some piece of script into npm under my name, so that I can understand how to share code through NPM. I had to come up with something that was atleast a little useful. I've seen some programmers who headers on their site like, "I am a Developer" and then the Developer word will swap out or be 'backspaced' and replaced with other descriptors. "I am a Div Slinger", "I am a Web Ninja" etc. [Example](https://wesbos.com/)

I did a quick look on NPM and found a few React components that gave a stab at this kind of issue.
