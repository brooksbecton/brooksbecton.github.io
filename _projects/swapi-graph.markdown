# SWAPI Graph

I had started making a few posts about how asynchronous code works in JavaScript. At the the end of these I wanted to make a challenge so that someone could get some practice with the new ideas they had just learned about. Also, I would use the [SWAPI](https://swapi.co/) as a data source. 

Why?
1. It's completely open, no keys required
2. It's Star Wars. 

The ending challenge for one was to follow a chain of resources from the SWAPI to help users see what callback hell can look/feel like.
