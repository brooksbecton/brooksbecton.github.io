## Programming

I mostly deal in JavaScript technology, but like to try different languages and frameworks. Dealing mostly in React, makes me want to try different backend technologies. I've been interested in trying frameworks like Laravel, Rails, or ASP. I understand most syntax and smaller programming paradigms, but I want to learn morn about how to structure programs to allow programs to scale in both performance and flexibility.

## Dogs

### Peyton

Peyton is a labradoodle mix with black wiry hair. Peyton is about 2 years old and knows most basic commands very well. He is extremely social. He loves other dogs. We try to let him socialize, but he gets very hyper and very vocal when other dogs are around.

### Harvey

Harvey is our newest dog. He is a blue heeler and is about 13 weeks old. He is learning some basic commands and obedience, but is still very much a puppy. He loves to eat. Apparently, they had so many puppies that the mother couldn't't produce enough milk for the entire litter. They were told to feed the dogs eggs and milk, so before we hot Harvey he was used to a heavy diet. When we feed him now, he hops or runs to the food bowl looking for his eggs and milk.

Both dogs are still getting adjusted to each other, but enjoy each others company. They are jealous of each other though. They love being in the spotlight. If one is getting attention, the other will walk in front of the other.
